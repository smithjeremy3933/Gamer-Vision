An app I am designing for game developers to manage the many components that make up a video game. I started working on this app after I started to realize that just keeping track of my goals on Github was not enough. Including planning how the build scalable code, I also had to think about how the user interface would work, character progression, level design, story, player experience etc... I also want it to be a platform for Indy game developers to talk to each other and discuss different ideas.
